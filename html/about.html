            <h2>Health care in Egypt</h2>
            <p>In Egypt there are healthcare services from the public and private sectors. Public health coverage is provided through the Ministry of Health, which operates a series of medical facilities that provide free health services. There are two types of private insurance companies. The General Authority for Health Insurance covers working people, students, and widows through premiums deducted from employees' salaries and employers' schedules. It operates its own network of medical facilities and sometimes contracts with private healthcare providers. Therapeutic care organization works for select government organizations and contracts with other entities to provide care. Also private insurance options, and a network of private healthcare providers and medical facilities. In addition, many mosques run their own clinics, especially in large cities. Many churches offer subsidized or free clinics.</p>
            <p>The medical care provided by the public health insurance system is usually of poor quality. Government hospitals are known to be neglectful and generally provide minimal care. Only about 6% of Egyptians covered by the Health Insurance Authority actually use its services due to dissatisfaction with the level of services it funds. In 2008/2009, 72% of health expenditures in Egypt were paid out of pocket for people seeking treatment.</p>
            <p>Egypt is currently working on reforming its public healthcare system to improve its quality. A bill was approved in October 2017 that would increase the national contribution from 4% of current wages to 5%, with 4% to be paid by employers and 1% by employees. The Egyptian Medical Syndicate is concerned that this could lead to the privatization of public hospitals, especially those that may not meet the quality standards stipulated in the new law. They say only 20% of the 660 government hospitals are committed to safety and infection control standards.</p>
            <h5>Workforce</h5>
            <p>In 2014, about 70,000 human doctors worked in the Ministry's hospitals, and the number of pharmacists is estimated at 20,000, and the number of veterinarians is about 15,000. It rose to 91,000 human doctors, and about 22,000 dentists and 196,000 nurses in 2019. Doctors' salaries in Egypt are low. Monthly salaries range between 1,218 EGP ($69) and 6,365 EGP ($361) per month. Among the members of the Egyptian Medical Syndicate, only about a third work in the country.</p>
            <h5>Pharmaceutical production</h5>
            <p>In the latest report of the Arab Federation of Producers of Medicines and Medical Supplies of the League of Arab States in 2011, Egypt ranked first in the Arab world in the production of medicines, with a production value of $2810 million. It also ranked first in terms of the number of pharmaceutical factories, amounting to 85 factories.</p>
            <h5>Infrastructure and hospitals of Egypt</h5>
            <p>Hospitals in the government sector contain about 95,000 beds, about 9,500 intensive care units, more than half of which are in university hospitals. The number of public hospitals is more than 660, followed by health offices and health care units, which are smaller facilities than hospitals, with 5,314 facilities nationwide. Among the most important hospitals in Egypt today: Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital (which also includes all medical faculties of Cairo University), Childrenâ€™s Cancer Hospital 57357, Liver Research Institute and Hospital in Mansoura, Aswan Heart Center, and others.</p>
